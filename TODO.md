- Add error code for the front end to proper parse and handle it
- do we need to add something like requestId for proper tracing??
- structured logging


- Change to use CreateUserRequest, UpdateUserRequest

- Does the hibernate join will slow us down our application???
- A lot of @Transactional, do we really need them??
